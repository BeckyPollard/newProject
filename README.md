### Start coding!

This repo aims to be a quick way to set up a snappy development environment. It'll process .scss files, ES6, and start a local server that automatically refreshes on change of watched files. Dig around in the `gulp.js` file to learn more about what's happening under the hood. Check out the [Gulp.js docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/v3.9.1/docs) for more gulp information.
